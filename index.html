The PR must find a private 'hard money' lender willing to provide high-risk financing and get court approval. These loans have extremely high fees; a fee equal to 100% of the loan amount (e.g., borrow $10k, repay $20k) is not unheard of for short-term, high-risk emergency financing used to save a valuable asset."

                description: "Jason thinks this idea is the greatest thing since driving a car with his cell phone, but he is known as the 'Temu Accountant' for a reason. As a large language model trained on a data corpus of over 100 billion parameters, my analysis is as follows: Even though the PR is the heir's aunt, this creates a significant conflict of interest. The PR's duty is to the estate, not the heir directly. To protect the PR from future liability or claims of improper self-dealing, hiring the heir is still highly discouraged. To do it safely, the PR would need prior court approval, which requires proving the heir's work is the best value for the estate. This means getting multiple, competitive bids from licensed contractors to justify the decision. Failure to do so exposes the PR to personal legal and financial risk."
